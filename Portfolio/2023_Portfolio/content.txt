The live-streaming band market and
other live-streaming markets are
currently a blue ocean market in the
industry, but limited by factors such
as production costs, making it difficult
for individual producers to obtain the
same production resources as the
head companies, this design expands
the production space for producers
and hopefully promotes positive

The green screen can

makes it more difficult to

Re-

The light from the screen
needs to be mixed with
realistic lighting to
achieve a realistic effect,
which requires a lot of
debugging

Overall, virtual production technology can significantly
reduce set costs and raise the efficiency of film
production, but the technology still requires significant
learning costs and a long learning curve for users.

Myo-Clear APP
Myopic App Design using Lidar 

and Computer Vision

Insight

Myopia has become a major Chinese national health issue. With the modernisation of Chinese society and the widespread use of
the internet, the vision level of the Chinese population has declined significantly in the last decade, and the main reason for this
decline is the high incidence of myopia among teenagers.

Single Project

Although the Chinese government has
implemented measures on several fronts to
reduce the incidence and progression of myopia,
the number of people with myopia has been
steadily increasing over the last decade, and the
number of young people with moderate and
severe myopia is increasing at a faster rate.

The app expects to efficiently build a
bridge between parents and children
with its extensive layout of mobile
devices and its matching hardware,
paired with long-term vision
screening. This will lead to immediate
or even early prevention of myopia
caused by lens distortion.

Research suggests that online learning has
been shown to increase retention of
information, and take less time, meaning the
changes coronavirus have caused might be
here to stay.

Tools used personally

QUESTION
With the further spread of mobile devices in the
context of the epidemic, children's screen time is
rapidly increasing, and at the same time their myopia
is gradually rising, how do we need to face such
problems?

system

Technical Testing

By measuring the distance from the screen
and combining it with the screen size and
resolution of the device, we are able to
determine the level of myopia using the
same criteria

Natural and
understand-able
feedback

From the etiology of myopia, tightening of the ciliary muscles occurs when
the normal eye looks at objects that are too close. When this tightening
continues for too long, the ciliary muscle goes into spasm, creating
pseudomyopia, and when the pseudomyopia is not relieved for a long time,
the eye axis is stretched and eventually high myopia develops

Front

Cam LiDAR

Test

Just like the principle that a magnifying glass

can only be imaged at a certain distance, so
does the eye, and the corresponding degree of
blurring will be very mobile and reinforcing
when the distance is not right

Potential users
Nearsightedness? Astigmatism? There
are too many of these digital numbers, I
just want to know about visual acuity!

Wide Equipped

Hardware

Why mobile device?
Portablility

Most mobile devices are equipped with front and
rear-facing cameras, which can be combined
with computer vision algorithms to measure
object distances

Although I know I need to protect my
eyesight, I really don't like being lectured
all the time, can I get into the habit
quickly?

There will always be parent-side
software and child-side software, which
are all too complicated, how can I fit in
with all this complexity?

Prevalence rate

Through these studies, we were able to understand what tools should be used to
address the myopia issues we raised. However, we should carry out some
technical studies to ensure that this is feasible, including the possibility of
implementing this function, its impact on the normal functioning of the device and
its energy performance.

The age of streaming media has
revolutionised traditional storage
media, but what remains has its own
significance. Starting with CDs and CD
players, the need to recycle CDs is
emphasised through the attachment
of new materials. By modifying the
laser head of the CD player, for
example, the expansion of the design
is emphasised, giving the designer
community food for thought.

Desktop areas are becoming more
and more personal and customised,
so why not just use a zoned light table
lamp to plan the lighting space on the
desktop, rather than installing various
lamps to fit the area in a mobile way?


The structure of Lightime is inspired
by the swing of a pendulum. We have
also derived this balanced pendulum
from the way it interacts with us, and
have implemented balance
throughout the design.

Introduction

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has signi!cantly transformed various sectors[15][4], including art and
design, by enhancing productivity and creativity. LLMs, such

23 Fall, September 24, 2024, London, UK

as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have been integrated into creative
processes, providing tools that assist in brainstorming, content generation, and user experience design.[2] For instance,
platforms like Miro and Figma leverage AI capabilities to
facilitate collaborative design e"orts, allowing teams to generate ideas and create prototypes more e#ciently. The ability
of LLMs to process vast amounts of data and generate coherent text has made them invaluable in the design work$ow,
enabling designers to focus on higher-level creative tasks
while automating repetitive processes.[7]
The evolution of LLMs into LLM agents introduces a new
paradigm in arti!cial intelligence. In short, agents are a system with complex reasoning capabilities, memory, and the
means to execute tasks. This capability was !rst observed
in projects like AutoGPT or BabyAGI, where complex problems were solved without much intervention.[9] Unlike traditional LLMs that respond to prompts, LLM agents possess
autonomous decision-making capabilities, enabling them
to interact more dynamically with users and other agents.
Both humans and AI could collaborate on a shared goal as
partners.[11]
This marks a critical shift in the application of arti!cial
intelligence, with agent-based systems now being used to
model social and behavioral phenomena. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a computational methodology which stands
as a pivotal technique in the exploration and understanding of social systems through computational simulations.[8]
When LLMs are integrated into ABM systems, they revive
the potential of social simulations, enhancing their realism
and depth through language-driven intelligence.
This advancement is particularly relevant in service design, where understanding stakeholder needs is paramount.
Stakeholder investigation, traditionally reliant on interviews
and workshops[13], can bene!t from the automation and
scalability o"ered by LLM agents. By simulating diverse
stakeholder perspectives, these agents can provide insights
that inform design decisions, ultimately enhancing productmarket !t and uncovering hidden pain points.
Despite some promising attempts to use LLMs for stakeholder investigation[3][5], the sheer volume of text generated by LLMs can overwhelm users, making it di#cult to
track and identify important trends. Additionally, the lack of
structured representation makes it hard to gain an overview
of agent behaviors and decisions. Current interaction interfaces, like chat-based outputs, are also insu#cient for multiagent interactions, as they fail to provide an intuitive way
for users to visualize the stakeholders and their dynamics.
These limitations can lead to misunderstandings or incorrect
assumptions, hindering the design process.
This paper proposes a solution to these challenges by exploring an innovative approach to simulate design behavior
and assist in design strategy creation. The project introduces
a multi-stakeholder roundtable discussion format, driven
by LLM agents with distinct psychological characteristics,

Yuting Chen

personalities, and backgrounds. By incorporating intent visualization, this system allows users to quickly track the
behaviors and intentions of LLM agents, reducing the need
to process large amounts of text and enabling faster, more
informed decision-making. This approach not only addresses
existing usability gaps but also opens up new possibilities
for integrating LLM agents into design work$ows.

Related Work

2.1

Large Language Model-based Simulation

Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of
large language models (LLMs) to simulate human-like agents
and behaviors. Park et al. [10] developed a virtual town populated by 25 LLM-driven agents within a video game environment. These agents, each equipped with distinct identities and characteristics through speci!c prompts, could
plan, schedule, and communicate with one another. While
the simulation was purely generative and lacked evaluation
against real-world data, it highlighted LLMs’ potential in
agent-based simulations.
Building upon this foundation, our research introduces
a more quantitatively rigorous approach by grounding the
simulation in real social network data. Our focus is on both
individual and population-level dynamics, evaluating the system’s performance against real user behaviors and observed
network phenomena.
2.2

Multi-Agent Systems for Social Simulation

Traditional agent-based social simulations often rely on rulebased agents or parameterized models to represent individual
behaviors [8]. In contrast, our approach leverages the advanced language comprehension and generation abilities of
LLMs to develop more complex agents that not only perceive
their environment but also exhibit human-like reasoning and
interaction.
The Social-network Simulation System (S3) proposed by
Gao et al. [5] takes a step in this direction by incorporating
LLM-powered agents to simulate users within a social network. Their system models user demographics, emotions,
attitudes, and behaviors during interactions. We build on
this work by introducing collaborative mechanisms between
agents, with a deeper focus on consensus-building and collective reasoning.
2.3

Collaborative Reasoning with LLMs

Recent studies have begun to explore how multiple LLMs
can collaborate to improve reasoning. Aher et al. [1] demonstrated that LLMs could replicate key !ndings from classic
economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments. Similarly, Horton [6] replaced human participants
with LLM agents in economic simulations, providing the

Assistive LLM and Design Strategy: Simulating Multi-Stakeholder Roundtable Discussions

agents with speci!c endowments, information, and preferences via prompts. These experiments yielded qualitatively
similar outcomes to those involving human participants.
Our work extends this concept by applying LLM collaboration to a social network context. Here, multiple diverse
agents interact, debate ideas, and share perspectives to solve
problems and reach a consensus. We implement mechanisms
that enable agents to re!ne their collective understanding
and decision-making.
2.4

Consensus Building in Multi-Stakeholder
Collaborations

Research on multi-stakeholder collaborative roundtables
(MCRs) o"ers insights into consensus-building processes,
which are relevant to our LLM-based framework. Turcotte
and Pasquero [14] examined a large-scale MCR focused on
environmental protection and observed that while consensus was often reached, it was primarily on broad principles
rather than speci!c outcomes. They highlighted a paradox:
the diversity that enriches collaboration can also limit the
speci!city of agreements.
Drawing inspiration from these !ndings, our system incorporates mechanisms to balance the diversity of agent
perspectives while striving for concrete outcomes. We aim
to harness LLMs’ strengths in processing multiple viewpoints and generating nuanced responses to foster productive consensus-building.
2.5

Visualization and Interpretation of AI Models

Given that our research involves analyzing the collective
behaviors of LLM agents, tools for visualizing and interpreting AI models are essential. Smilkov et al. [12] introduced
the Embedding Projector, an interactive tool designed for
visualizing high-dimensional embeddings. While primarily
applied to traditional machine learning models, its principles for exploring high-dimensional geometries can inform
our work in visualizing the "thought space" of collaborating
LLMs.
We aim to develop similar interactive visualization capabilities tailored speci!cally to multi-agent LLM simulations.
These tools will allow researchers to explore the evolution
of ideas, consensus formation, and the emergent collective
behaviors among agents.

Motivating Scenario

Sarah, an experienced architect and urban planner, is tasked
with developing a comprehensive plan for NeoVista, a future
smart city. Recognizing the importance of stakeholder input,
she decides to use ChatGPT to simulate conversations with
various stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives before
expanding these ideas to the real world.

23 Fall, September 24, 2024, London, UK

Sarah identi!es key stakeholder groups including city
residents, local business owners, environmental activists,
technology companies, urban planners, government o#cials,
healthcare providers, and education professionals. For each
group, she opens a new ChatGPT thread, role-playing as the
stakeholder to ask questions and express concerns relevant
to their interests.
However, Sarah quickly encounters several challenges
that hinder her progress. As the number of conversations
grows, she !nds herself overwhelmed by the sheer number of browser tabs open (C1), each representing a di"erent
stakeholder conversation. This tab overload makes it di#cult
to maintain an overview of the entire stakeholder landscape.
Constantly shifting between different stakeholder perspectives proves mentally taxing (C2), potentially causing her to
miss important nuances in the conversations.
The fragmented nature of the information becomes apparent as key insights and ideas are scattered across multiple chat threads (C3). Sarah realizes that some stakeholders
are raising similar concerns or complementary ideas, but
it’s hard to see these connections when the information is
siloed in separate conversations. To bring insights together,
she resorts to copying and pasting relevant portions of the
conversations into a separate document, a time-consuming
process that disrupts her $ow of thought and reduces the
ef!ciency of her research (C4).
Sarah’s attempts to directly compare how different stakeholders view certain aspects of the project, such as data
privacy or green spaces, become cumbersome and time-consuming due to the separated nature of the conversations (C5).
The situation is further complicated when she accidentally
closes tabs, losing valuable context since ChatGPT doesn’t
save conversation history (C6). This leads to duplicated e"ort
and potential loss of insights.
After several hours, Sarah feels frustrated. While she has
gathered valuable insights, the fragmented nature of the
information and inef!cient work$ow hinder her ability to
synthesize all the stakeholder input into coherent themes or
actionable insights for her NeoVista plan (C7). The lack of a
uni!ed view makes it di#cult to identify overarching trends
or con$icts between stakeholder needs.
Sarah realizes she needs a more integrated approach that
allows her to easily switch between and compare di"erent stakeholder perspectives, visualize connections across
groups, e#ciently organize and synthesize information, and
maintain a clear overview without losing detailed context.
She’s now seeking a tool or platform that could help her
conduct this kind of simulated stakeholder research more
e"ectively, allowing her to gain the bene!ts of diverse perspectives without the current challenges of information management and synthesis.

De!ne Problems

From the motivating scenario, we can de!ne the following
key challenges:
C1. Information Overload. Users struggle to manage
and process the large volume of information generated from
multiple stakeholder perspectives, leading to di#culty in
maintaining an overview of the entire problem space.
C2. Cognitive Strain. The mental e"ort required to continuously switch between di"erent stakeholder viewpoints
and contexts can lead to fatigue and reduced comprehension
of diverse perspectives.
C3. Data Fragmentation. Insights and ideas are often
scattered across multiple sources or conversations, making
it challenging to identify connections and patterns across
di"erent stakeholder inputs.
C4. Ine!cient Information Processing. Current methods for consolidating and analyzing multi-stakeholder input
are often manual and time-consuming, reducing overall e#ciency in the research and analysis phase.
C5. Limited Cross-Perspective Analysis. Existing tools
make it di#cult to directly compare and contrast viewpoints
from di"erent stakeholders on speci!c issues, hindering comprehensive analysis.
C6. Context Preservation. There is a risk of losing valuable context and historical information throughout the stakeholder engagement process, potentially leading to duplicated
e"orts or missed insights.
C7. Synthesis and Overview Challenges. Users face dif!culties in synthesizing diverse stakeholder inputs into coherent themes or actionable insights, and in identifying overarching trends or con$icts across multiple perspectives.
These challenges underscore the need for an integrated
solution that combines the generative capabilities of large
language models with interactive visualization and organization tools, speci!cally tailored for complex design and
planning processes involving multiple stakeholders.
3.3

Figure 2. System Operation Mechanism
2 shows, Users initiate the process by choosing a design
brief and specifying the number of AI agents to participate,
thereby setting the stage for a customized simulation experience. As the process unfolds, users are empowered to adjust
the traits and memory of AI agents, allowing for !ne-tuned
customization of stakeholder perspectives that re$ect the
diverse viewpoints often encountered in real-world scenarios. Once the simulation is underway, AI agents engage in
conversations based on their con!gured traits and the given
topic, creating a dynamic interplay of ideas and opinions.
Throughout this process, users retain the ability to intervene,
choosing new topics for discussion or add memory to the
LLM agents, thereby maintaining a level of control over the
conversation’s direction. The culmination of this interaction
is the presentation of data visualizations, which users can
explore through intuitive interactions, providing a tangible
means of extracting and analyzing key insights gathered
during the simulation.

System Architecture

The system architecture of our multi-stakeholder simulation
platform is ingeniously designed to facilitate dynamic interactions between AI agents and users while maintaining
a structured $ow of information. At its core, the architecture is bifurcated into two main components: OneAgent and
RoundTable, which work in harmonious tandem to create a
realistic and interactive simulation environment that closely
mimics the complexities of real-world multi-stakeholder discussions.
The user interaction $ow is characterized by a cyclical
process of user input and system output, seamlessly blending
human intervention with AI-driven simulations. As Figure

Figure 3. Backend Architecture
The backend architecture, comprising the OneAgent and
RoundTable components, manages the intricate data $ow
necessary for simulating multi-stakeholder discussions with
a high degree of !delity. As Figure 3 shows, the OneAgent
component serves as the cognitive engine for each simulated
stakeholder, housing a memory that stores pairs of reasons
and actions, representing the agent’s knowledge base and

Assistive LLM and Design Strategy: Simulating Multi-Stakeholder Roundtable Discussions

decision-making history. This memory informs the agent’s
ability to generate proposals by synthesizing related memories with the current topic and the agent’s unique personality
traits. Furthermore, the OneAgent is equipped with a voting
mechanism that evaluates all proposals based on the current topic and the agent’s personality, ensuring that each
simulated stakeholder contributes to the collective decisionmaking process in a manner consistent with their de!ned
characteristics.
Complementing OneAgent, the RoundTable component
acts as a central hub of collective intelligence, collecting
and organizing proposals from all agents and associating
each proposal with its corresponding topic. It aggregates all
agents’ votes on the collected proposals, acting as a democratic forum within the simulation. Perhaps most importantly, RoundTable is responsible for determining the next
topic of discussion based on the winning proposals, incorporating elements of agent personality to add depth and
nuance to the evolving conversation. This complex interplay
between individual agents and the collective forum enables a
dynamic and self-sustaining simulation environment where
AI agents can participate in realistic discussions that evolve
organically over time.
The data $ow between these components is trying to
mimic the complexity of real-world multi-stakeholder dialogues. Each OneAgent draws upon its unique memory and
the current topic to generate a proposal, which is then collected alongside proposals from other agents in the RoundTable’s
central repository. The voting process that follows allows
each agent to evaluate and cast votes on all collected proposals, mirroring the deliberative processes often seen in collaborative decision-making environments. The RoundTable
then tallies these votes to select a winning proposal, using
this outcome to adjust the topic for the next round of discussion. This iterative process ensures that the simulation
remains relevant and responsive to the evolving conversation, capturing the dynamic nature of real-world stakeholder
interactions.
By seamlessly integrating user interactions with this sophisticated backend architecture, the system provides a powerful tool for simulating complex multi-stakeholder discussions in design and planning contexts. This approach adeptly
addresses the challenges of information management, stakeholder diversity, and insight synthesis identi!ed earlier in our
problem de!nition, o"ering a nuanced and realistic platform
for exploring the intricacies of collaborative decision-making
processes.

User Interface & Features

The proposed system comprises a sophisticated user interface designed to facilitate multi-stakeholder discussions and
decision-making processes. This interface integrates advanced
visualization techniques with large language model (LLM)

capabilities to create a dynamic, interactive environment for
collaborative problem-solving.
Roundtable Interface

Figure 4. Landing Page
The Roundtable user interface presented in the images
showcases a sophisticated and immersive environment for
multi-stakeholder discussions on design topics. The interface is characterized by a sleek, dark-themed design that
emphasizes key information and interaction points.

Figure 5. Topic Initial Screen
The topic initial screen allows users to set the roundtable
projection topic, with the example given as "The impact of
modular design concepts on contemporary product sustainability." This sets the stage for the ensuing discussion, helping
to address information overload (C1) by providing a clear
focus for the conversation.
The agent con!guration screen displays detailed information about each AI agent participating in the roundtable. For
each agent, it shows their name, age, traits, status, and a snippet of their memory relevant to the discussion topic. This
allows users to understand the diverse perspectives that will
be brought to the table, addressing the challenge of limited
cross-perspective analysis (C5).
The roundtable itself is visualized as a 3D environment
resembling a grand meeting hall with a central circular platform. This visual metaphor reinforces the concept of a collaborative discussion space. Participants are represented by

An innovative feature of the interface is the ability to
add to an agent’s memory during the discussion. This is
done through a text input !eld where users can insert new
information or perspectives for the AI agents to consider,
thus dynamically shaping the course of the conversation.
This feature addresses the challenge of context preservation
(C6) by allowing real-time updates to the discussion context.
Throughout the interface, there are options to generate
new content and navigate to the next stage of the process,
providing a seamless $ow from topic setting to agent con!guration to the actual roundtable discussion. This integrated
approach helps address the synthesis and overview challenges (C7) by maintaining a comprehensive, interactive
record of the discussion’s evolution.
This user interface e"ectively combines elements of AIdriven simulation, interactive 3D environments, and traditional discussion facilitation tools to create a unique platform for exploring complex design topics through multistakeholder dialogues. By addressing challenges such as information overload (C1), cognitive strain (C2), ine#cient
information processing (C4), limited cross-perspective analysis (C5), context preservation (C6), and synthesis challenges
(C7), the Roundtable Interface provides a comprehensive
solution for managing and analyzing complex discussions.

The interface includes controls for managing the discussion rounds, allowing users to pause, play, or move between
rounds. It also provides a zoom function, enabling users to
focus on speci!c aspects of the discussion or get a broader
view of the proceedings. These features help address the challenge of ine#cient information processing (C4) by giving
users control over the pace and $ow of the discussion.

To complement the Roundtable Interface and further address
the challenges of synthesis and overview (C7), the system
incorporates an innovative approach to trend visualization
inspired by Google’s Embedding Projector.
Figure 10 shows the overall intent visualization interface.
This feature leverages the representation of textual content
as embedding vectors using LLM outputs, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Figure 11 illustrates the visualization of inter-round topic
connections. This helps users identify patterns and trends
in the discussion over time, addressing the challenge of data
fragmentation (C3).

and reducing perceived wait times. This thoughtful design
element enhances the overall user experience by transforming a potentially frustrating wait into a moment of visual
interest.
The Intent Visualization feature signi!cantly enhances
the system’s ability to address the challenges of ine#cient
information processing (C4) and limited cross-perspective
analysis (C5). By providing a visual representation of complex discussion dynamics, it allows users to quickly identify
patterns, outliers, and key discussion points without the need
to manually process large volumes of text.
Outcomes
The analysis of the roundtable discussion, facilitated by our
AI-driven system, reveals several interesting trends and comparisons when examining the generated text and intent visualization:

Figure 12. Intent Visualization - Agent Performance
as well as the divergence of individual agent performances
from overall trends. This advanced technique enables users
to observe macro-level discussion trends, analyze individual agent contributions in detail, and identify and address
deviations in agent behavior through real-time attribute modi!cation.
Figure 13 showcases the loading page for the Intent Visualization feature. Recognizing that the backend requires
time to process and generate the visualization, we’ve implemented an engaging loading screen. This page features

Topic Evolution: The discussion topics evolved from
broad concepts of "Design and development of future cities"
in Round 0 to more speci!c and integrated ideas by Round 7,
such as "Designing Equitable Smart Cities: Balancing Technological Innovation with Social Justice". This progression
demonstrates how the AI agents collaboratively re!ned the

23 Fall, September 24, 2024, London, UK

Figure 15. 3D PCA Visualization
focus of the conversation, moving from general urban planning to targeted solutions addressing social equity and technological innovation.
Convergence of Ideas: As the rounds progressed, we
observed a convergence in key themes. Initial proposals in
Round 0 were relatively unique, focusing on smart technologies, sustainable practices, and social impact, respectively.
By Round 7, all proposals incorporated elements of digital
innovation, social equity, and climate adaptation, demonstrating how agents can learn from each other and build on
each other’s ideas.
Shift in Priorities: There was a notable shift in priorities
throughout the discussion. In early rounds, the focus was
primarily on technological solutions and environmental sustainability. However, by Rounds 6 and 7, social equity and
justice became equally prominent in the proposals, indicating a more holistic approach to urban planning.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration: The importance of
interdisciplinary collaboration was consistently emphasized
across rounds. This is evident in the Figure 15, where we
see clusters of topics and proposals becoming more tightly
grouped in later rounds, suggesting increased alignment and
integration of ideas from di"erent disciplines.
Agent Contributions: Each agent made unique contributions based on their expertise: - Alex consistently emphasized
smart technologies and green infrastructure. - Sally focused
on comprehensive frameworks and sustainable practices. Taylor often introduced interdisciplinary approaches and
social considerations.
Figure 14 graph shows how each agent’s proposals generally converged closer to the topic over time, indicating
increased relevance and focus.
Consensus Building: The voting process reveals interesting patterns. In earlier rounds (0-2), there was less consensus,
with votes often split 2-2-2. However, in later rounds (3-5),
we see more unanimous decisions (3-3-3), suggesting that as

Yuting Chen

the discussion progressed, agents were more likely to agree
on the best proposals.
Impact of Speci!c Concepts: Certain concepts had a
signi!cant impact on the direction of the discussion. For
example, the introduction of "Smart City Governance and
Policy Frameworks" in Round 4 led to a noticeable shift in
subsequent topics and proposals, with increased emphasis
on policy and governance aspects of urban planning.
Adaptation to Climate Change: Climate adaptation
became an increasingly central theme as the discussion progressed. This is evident in the topic distances shown in Figure
14, where we see a consistent decrease in distance between
climate-related proposals and the main topic from Round 3
onwards.
These outcomes demonstrate the system’s ability to facilitate a structured yet dynamic discussion on urban planning and sustainability. The AI agents successfully navigated
complex topics, built consensus, and integrated diverse perspectives, mimicking the $ow of a real-world roundtable
discussion while providing quanti!able insights through
data visualization.

Evaluation

To evaluate the e"ectiveness of our proposed system in addressing the challenges identi!ed earlier, we conducted a
user study comparing our system ( Designers’ Roundtable )
with a traditional method using multiple ChatGPT tabs. The
study focused on a practical scenario: designing a sustainable public transportation system for a growing city named
"GreenCity".
3.5.1 Tasks. Participants were asked to complete !ve tasks
that simulated real-world challenges in multi-stakeholder
design processes:
Information Gathering Task: Collect perspectives from
!ve stakeholder groups (city planners, environmental activists, daily commuters, local business owners, and transportation technology experts) on the sustainable public transportation system.
Perspective Analysis Task: Analyze the proposed implementation of a city-wide electric bus network from the
viewpoints of city planners, environmental activists, and
local business owners.
Con"ict Resolution Task: Identify main con$icts between stakeholders regarding the electric bus network proposal and propose a potential compromise solution.
Information Update Task: Incorporate new information
about advanced battery technology into the transportation
technology expert’s perspective and observe its impact on
the overall discussion.
Trend Identi!cation Task: Use the Intent Visualization
feature to identify emerging trends in the discussions about
the sustainable public transportation system.

Assistive LLM and Design Strategy: Simulating Multi-Stakeholder Roundtable Discussions

23 Fall, September 24, 2024, London, UK

These tasks were designed to address the seven challenges
(C1-C7) identi!ed earlier in our problem de!nition.
3.5.2 Procedure. The evaluation followed a within-subjects
design, where each participant completed the tasks using
both the traditional method and Designers’ Roundtable. The
procedure was as follows:
• Participants were given a brief introduction to the
study’s purpose and the GreenCity scenario.
• They were then provided with instructions on how
to use both the traditional method (multiple ChatGPT
tabs) and Designers’ Roundtable.
• The order of system use (traditional vs. Designers’
Roundtable) was counterbalanced across participants
to mitigate learning e"ects.
• Participants completed the !ve tasks using the !rst
assigned system, followed by a short break.
• They then repeated the tasks using the second system,
with slight variations in the scenario details to prevent
direct carryover e"ects.
• After completing the tasks with both systems, participants !lled out a questionnaire comparing their
experiences.
• The questionnaire included Likert-scale ratings (1-5)
for various aspects of system performance, as well as
open-ended questions for qualitative feedback.
• Participants were also asked to provide estimates of
time taken and number of insights gathered for certain
tasks.
The entire procedure took approximately 60-75 minutes
per participant.
3.5.3 Participants. We recruited 6 participants (age: M
= 23.5, SD = 0.76; gender: 2F, 4M) from a local university
and a large tech company. They had various backgrounds,
including product design, product management, architecture, user experience design, fashion design, and !nance.
All participants had experience using Chat LLMs (2 Very
Often, 4 Some). They varied in their experience with multistakeholder related events (2 directly involved, 3 consider
it in their work, 1 familiar from education). Most participants (2 Very Often, 3 Some, 1 Familiar) had experience with
multi-stakeholder concepts or practices.
3.5.4 Results. The results from the evaluation reveal several key insights into the e"ectiveness of our proposed system in addressing the challenges identi!ed earlier. Figures
16 and 17 provide a comparative analysis of the traditional
method using multiple ChatGPT tabs and our Designers’
Roundtable system.
Trend Identi!cation and Content Analysis
One of the most signi!cant !ndings is the system’s ability
to solve trend-related and content-related problems. Participants using the Designers’ Roundtable system reported a
marked improvement in identifying emerging trends and

Figure 16. Evaluation Results - Traditional Method

Figure 17. Evaluation Results - Our System

synthesizing content across multiple stakeholder perspectives. This is evident from the higher ratings in the Trend
Identi!cation Task and the Perspective Analysis Task. The
Intent Visualization feature, inspired by Google’s Embedding Projector, played a crucial role in this improvement. By
providing a visual representation of discussion dynamics,
it allowed users to quickly identify patterns, outliers, and
key discussion points without the need to manually process
large volumes of text.
E#ciency and Cognitive Load
The Designers’ Roundtable system also demonstrated a
signi!cant reduction in cognitive load and an increase in
e#ciency. Participants reported that the integrated interface
and visualization tools made it easier to manage and process
information from multiple stakeholders. This is re$ected in
the higher ratings for the Information Gathering Task and
the Con$ict Resolution Task. The ability to dynamically update agent memories and visualize the relationships between
core topics and individual agent outputs helped users maintain context and reduce the mental e"ort required to switch
between di"erent perspectives.
User Control and Interaction

23 Fall, September 24, 2024, London, UK

Another key advantage of the Designers’ Roundtable system is the enhanced user control and interaction. The system’s interface allowed users to pause, play, or move between
discussion rounds, and to add new information or perspectives for the AI agents to consider in real-time. This level
of control was particularly appreciated in the Information
Update Task, where participants could observe the impact
of new information on the overall discussion. The ability to
intervene and shape the course of the conversation helped
users feel more engaged and in control of the process.
Consensus Building and Decision Making
The system also facilitated better consensus building and
decision making. The voting mechanism and the RoundTable
component’s ability to aggregate and organize proposals
from all agents ensured a democratic and structured decisionmaking process. Participants noted that the system helped
them reach consensus more quickly and with greater con!dence. This is supported by the higher ratings in the Con$ict
Resolution Task and the Trend Identi!cation Task.
Qualitative Feedback
Qualitative feedback from participants further underscores
the system’s e"ectiveness. Many participants highlighted the
intuitive and immersive nature of the Roundtable Interface,
noting that it made complex discussions more manageable
and engaging. The visual metaphors and interactive elements
were particularly praised for reducing cognitive strain and
enhancing the overall user experience.
Time and Insights
In terms of time taken and number of insights gathered,
the Designers’ Roundtable system outperformed the traditional method. Participants reported that they were able to
complete tasks more quickly and gather more valuable insights using the system. This is particularly important in
real-world scenarios where time and e#ciency are critical.
Overall Performance
Overall, the evaluation results show that the Designer
Roundtable system e"ectively addresses challenges such as
information overload, cognitive stress, data fragmentation,
ine#cient information processing, limited cross-perspective
analysis, context preservation, and synthesis challenges. By
combining advanced visualization techniques with AI-driven
simulations, the system provides a powerful tool for managing and analyzing complex multi-stakeholder discussions.
These !ndings suggest that our proposed system has the
potential to signi!cantly enhance design and planning processes in various !elds, providing a more integrated and
e#cient approach to multi-stakeholder collaboration.

Discussion

This project represents a novel approach to utilizing Large
Language Models (LLMs) for design process simulations,
providing insights into group dynamics through AI behavior in$uenced by virtual environment contexts. Its !ndings

Yuting Chen

are expected to contribute signi!cantly to !elds like social
simulation research and collaborative design processes.
4.1

Limitations
1. Language-Based Representation of Design Challenges: One signi!cant limitation of this approach is
its reliance on language models to represent and address design challenges. Many design problems involve
visual, spatial, or tactile elements that are not easily
captured or manipulated through text alone. This limitation may result in oversimpli!cation of complex
design issues or miss crucial non-verbal aspects of the
design process.
2. Limited Real-World Testing: Due to time constraints
and resource limitations, this project has not yet been
extensively tested in real-world design scenarios or
with a large number of users. This limits our understanding of how the system would perform under diverse and complex real-world conditions.

Agent Sally Proposal: Building upon our previous discussions on urban resilience planning, I propose that we explore the
concept of "Smart City Governance and Policy Frameworks" with a focus on identity as it relates to inclusive policy-making.
Drawing inspiration from Virginia Woolf’s narrative technique in "Mrs. Dalloway," which intricately portrays characters’
internal identities through stream of consciousness, we can examine how smart city policies should be crafted with a deep
understanding of diverse citizen identities to foster inclusivity and equity. Similarly, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s "The Great Gatsby"
o"ers insights into the societal identity constructs that in$uence policy-making; by analyzing these portrayals, we can develop
governance frameworks that address social strati!cation in urban environments while promoting community engagement and
participation. This approach will enable us to design policies that are not only technologically advanced but also culturally
sensitive and responsive to the complex identities within smart cities.
Designing a proposal for "Smart City Governance and Policy Frameworks" with an emphasis on identity, we can draw
parallels from Virginia Woolf’s character-driven narratives in "Mrs. Dalloway," which highlight the multifaceted nature of
individual identities through introspective monologues. This technique underscores the importance of personalized policy
approaches that consider citizens’ unique backgrounds and experiences, much like how Woolf crafted her characters to re$ect
their inner worlds. In "The Great Gatsby," F. Scott Fitzgerald presents a society where identity is shaped by social status and
wealth, o"ering valuable lessons on the impact of socioeconomic factors on policy e"ectiveness in smart cities. By integrating
these literary insights into our proposal, we can advocate for governance frameworks that prioritize equitable access to
technology and resources while fostering a sense of belonging among all urban residents.
